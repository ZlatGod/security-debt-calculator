## üöÄ Quick Start

**[Try the Live Calculator ‚Üí](https://yourusername.github.io/security-debt-calculator)**

## üìä What is This?

This interactive calculator helps organizations quantify security debt accumulated through data governance tool proliferation. Based on research analyzing real-world financial institution deployments, it provides four key metrics:

- **ICD** (Integration Complexity Debt) - Measures API sprawl and credential complexity
- **CVG** (Compliance Visibility Gap) - Tracks fragmented audit capabilities  
- **ARI** (Architectural Risk Index) - Quantifies infrastructure vulnerabilities
- **OOD** (Operational Overhead Debt) - Calculates patching and maintenance burden

## üéØ Key Features

‚úÖ **Real-time Calculations** - Instant security debt assessment  
‚úÖ **Visual Analytics** - Charts showing debt accumulation and comparisons  
‚úÖ **Actionable Recommendations** - Specific guidance based on your metrics  
‚úÖ **No Installation Required** - Works directly in browser  
‚úÖ **Research-Backed** - Based on published academic framework

## üìö Research Paper

This calculator implements the framework from:

> **"Quantifying Security Debt in Multi-Tool Data Governance Architectures: A Framework for Financial Services Compliance"**

### Key Findings from Research:
- Tool sprawl increases security debt by **12x** in same-account AWS configurations
- Multi-account architecture reduces security debt by **50-75%**
- Integration failures create **72-hour vulnerability windows**
- Annual cost impact: **$13,846** in operational overhead

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### For Business Users
1. Visit the [live calculator](https://yourusername.github.io/security-debt-calculator)
2. Enter your organization's parameters:
   - Number of data governance tools
   - API integrations per tool
   - Authentication methods used
   - AWS account configuration
3. Review calculated metrics and recommendations
4. Share results with your security team

### For Developers
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-debt-calculator.git

# Open index.html in your browser

## üìñ Framework Formulas

### Integration Complexity Debt (ICD)
```
ICD = (Tools √ó APIs_per_tool √ó Credential_types) / Isolation_factor
```

**Risk Levels:**
- < 100: Low
- 100-500: Medium  
- 500-1000: High
- \> 1000: Critical

### Compliance Visibility Gap (CVG)
```
CVG = (Required_attributes - Captured_attributes) / Required_attributes √ó 100%
```

### Architectural Risk Index (ARI)
```
ARI = Network_exposure √ó Escalation_paths √ó Same_account_penalty
```

### Operational Overhead Debt (OOD)
```
OOD = (Patch_days + Approval_days) / Team_size
```

## üí° Use Cases

### 1. Architecture Review
Assess current security debt before major infrastructure changes

### 2. Tool Selection
Evaluate security impact of adding new data governance tools

### 3. Budget Justification
Calculate ROI for multi-account migration projects

### 4. Risk Assessment
Quantify security posture for compliance audits

## üìà Real-World Example

**Case Study: Financial Institution**

**Before (Single Scanner):**
- ICD: 25 (Low)
- 48-hour patch deployment

**After (4 Tools, Same Account):**
- ICD: 300 (Critical)
- 7-10 day patch deployment
- $27,000 integration failure incident

**After (Multi-Account Architecture):**
- ICD: 75 (Medium)
- 3-5 day patch deployment
- $53,846 annual savings
